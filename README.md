Beastmon system monitor
============

I'd seen the system monitor that okonk was working on and I thought it looked pretty sweet (his intent was that you could use it to monitor your PC remotely, ie from a smartphone). I'd been using the HWMonitor program from the CPUID people, but that didn't save window location or state (well, the standalone version I was using didn't), and took up a bunch of screen real estate and showed me stuff I didn't really care about. So I forked this one and hacked up a wee desktop version that shows me only the information I want to see, and saves its location. Convenient.

It's a bit rough, and will probably break if you have more than one CPU or GPU. I'll fix that one day.

I'm not really sure where the original code came from, it looks like it's all licensed under the Mozilla Public License though.
